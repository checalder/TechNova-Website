      <h3><u>DESCRIPTION:</u></h3>

      <p>Mafia II is a third person story game that tells the story of Vito Scaletta, who along with his childhood friend, Joe, will descend into the world of organized crime. Together, they will work to prove themselves to the Mafia as they try to make their names on the streets.</p>

      <p>Mafia II is the second installment in the mafia franchise, which steps away from the protagonist of the first game, Tommy Angelo, in exchange for Vito Scaletta, a decade later in Empire Bay. This game is notable for its storytelling, which has two distinct time periods - 1945 and 1951.</p>
    
      <p>Mafia II received "generally favorable reviews" for Windows, scoring a 77 on Metacritic.</p>
