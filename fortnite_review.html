      <h3><u>DESCRIPTION:</u></h3>

      <p>"Fortnite" emerged as a cultural phenomenon in the gaming world, developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It swiftly gained immense popularity for its unique blend of battle royale gameplay, vibrant graphics, and regular content updates that kept the experience fresh and engaging. Set in a colorful, cartoonish world, players engage in a last-person-standing battle, building structures, scavenging for weapons, and using their skills to outlast opponents in fast-paced, ever-shrinking arenas. </p>

      <p>Regarding its status as 'dying,' Fortnite has experienced fluctuations in its player base and cultural prominence since its peak in 2018-2019. While it's faced periods where interest seemed to wane slightly, especially with the emergence of newer titles and shifts in gaming trends, Fortnite's player numbers and influence have shown resilience.
